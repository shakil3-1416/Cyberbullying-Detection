# ML Cyberbullying Classification Repository: 
Explore the process of training and evaluating GRU, LSTM, and CNN models for cyberbullying classification. Data preprocessing steps include tokenization, cleaning, and encoding. Training metrics such as accuracy and loss are monitored, with models achieving initial accuracies of up to 96.30%. Classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves provide insights into model performance. Use precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate effectiveness in identifying cyberbullying instances.
